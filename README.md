Hello!
=============
... The idea of this project is to patch TheHenryStickminCollection over to the Raspberry Pi.
This is to help gamers on a low budget to make Youtube videos, or just play on cheap hardware!
Of course, This CAN run on.... Windows, osX(mac) and Linux
=============
You can run this online, and offline(support coming soon)
